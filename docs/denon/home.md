denon is the [deno](https://deno.land/) replacement for [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
providing a feature packed, highly configurable and easy to use experience.

denon does **not** require _any_ additional changes to your code or method of development. `denon` is a replacement wrapper for `deno`. To use `denon`,replace the word `deno` on the command line when executing your script.

## Features

Denon provides most of the features you would expect of a file watcher and more.

- Automatically restart your deno projects
- Drop-in replacement for `deno` executable
- Extensive configuration options with script support
- Configurable file watcher with support for filesystem events and directory walking
- Ignoring specific files or directories with [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) patterns
- Not limited to deno projects with a powerful script configuration
